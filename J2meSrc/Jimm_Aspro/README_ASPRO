================================================================================
This README describes changes in compiling process. Basic procedure is the same
as described in original README bundled with original Jimm sources (could be
on http://www.jimm.org). Aspro MOD sources need some extra for successful build:

Recommended resources
=====================
- Apache Ant 1.7.0 (http://ant.apache.org)
- Ant Contrib package 1.0b3 (http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/) * NEW TO ASPRO
- Sun JavaTM Wireless Toolkit 2.5.2 (http://java.sun.com/products/sjwtoolkit/)
- Java Runtime Environment jre1.6.0_05 (http://www.java.com/getjava/)
- Java Development Kit jdk1.6.0_05 (http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/)

Changing BUILD.XML to your needs
================================
Change the paths to resources listed above to your specific environment as usual
* e.g. <property name="WTK/DIR" location="c:\Program Files\WTK2.5.2"/>
* e.g. <property name="proguard" value="c:\Program Files\proguard"/>
* place ant-contrib-1.0b3.jar to apache-ant/lib directory
* create proper OS environment variables ANT_HOME, JAVA_HOME and place path to 
  your apache-ant directory into the existing PATH variable
* you don't need to change <taskdef resource="net/sf/antcontrib/antlib.xml"/>
* the BUILDS_LIST property contains the build you want to get, e.g.
  <property name="builds_list" value="Midp2full,Midp2Ani" />
  As you can see, multiple builds can be created if you specify them divided by
  commas.
* Don't forget to check the paths in section where MIDP API classes and all 
  extension classes required by the chosen target are specified. If you are on
  Linux, items are delimited by ":", if you are on Windows, items are delimited
  by ";"
